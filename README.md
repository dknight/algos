# Collection of algorithms and data structures written in Go.

For personal use. DO NOT RELY ON THIS CODE, every minute everything can be
changed.

### Notes

* All data structures are **not thread-safe**.
* This data structures are made for educational purposes, it is strongly not
  recommended to use them in production environments. Use it at own risk. For
  example for lists it is better to use [lists from standard
  library](https://pkg.go.dev/container/list).

#### Built-in data structures

Go has some built-in data structures out of box.

* Array `[n int]T`
* Map `map[T comparable]U`
* Slices `[]T`
* Structures `type T struct`

## Data structures

* Graph
* Lists
    - Linked List
    - Doubly Linked List (unfinished)
* Queues
    - Queue
* Set
* Stack

## Algorithms

* Balanced brackets
* Factorial
* Stocks problem
* Postfix notation

# TODO

More will be implemented soon.
